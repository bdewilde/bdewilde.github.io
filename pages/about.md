Hi! I'm Burton DeWilde, an end-to-end data scientist with 10+ years' experience in data product development, web analytics, applied research, and nonprofit consulting. I am passionate about solving meaningful problems using data, and empowering people to make positive change in the world.

Currently, I work as a data science engineer at [WeaveGrid], where I build data pipelines and products to more intelligently connect electric vehicles to the energy grid. Previously, I was a data scientist at [Chartbeat] and [Harmony Institute]. On the side, I've done pro bono data projects with [DataKind]; I volunteer and web admin for my (former) [neighborhood environmental org]; and I intermittently develop open-source software such as [`textacy`]. Before all that, I was a [particle physicist](/assets/documents/2012-06-20-thesis-defense.pdf), [zombie filmmaker](http://www.decayfilm.com), and [LGBT activist](https://pointfoundation.org/scholars/burt-dewilde).

I live in Burlington, VT with my husband and cats. In my free time, I do photography, make pottery, and play video games.
