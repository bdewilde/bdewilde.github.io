# bdewilde.github.io

Personal / professional website of Burton DeWilde, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

## initial setup

Follow the official jekyll docs [quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart) and/or the [full, step-by-step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), as well as the [GitHub Pages guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to get going. This will probably take a while (homebrew has a way of installing entire software ecosystems when you just want one thing).

## local development

This jekyll project uses `bundler` for dependency management, serving, etc. Read [this introductory tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) for basic usage.

To serve the site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and then go to http://localhost:4000 in a web browser. This command takes [many options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options); `./serve.sh` has a good configuration locked in. For more info on command line usage, see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage).
