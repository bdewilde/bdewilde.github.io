Hi! I'm a Data Scientist at a non-profit research organization called [Harmony Institute](http://harmony-institute.org/), where we study the social impact of media on individuals and society. I spend most of my time on data product development, but I also do some original research and client-focused work. My lifelong passions lie at the intersection of art, science, social activism, and all things data.

On the side, I enjoy volunteering for [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/), palling around with a data scientology collective known as [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com/), and indulging in travel and photography.

I got a Ph.D. in Physics from [Stony Brook University](http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/), through which I spent two years at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/) searching for [new fundamental particles of matter](/assets/documents/2012-06-20-thesis-defense.pdf) with the Large Hadron Collider. I blogged (intermittently) about it on [Quantum Diaries](http://www.quantumdiaries.org/author/burton-dewilde/). I also co-produced, filmed, and edited a feature-length, particle physics-themed zombie movie called [Decay](http://www.decayfilm.com/). Before all that, I graduated _summa cum laude_ from [Kalamazoo College](http://www.kzoo.edu/) with a double major in Physics and Spanish.

I grew up in Michigan, live in New York, and one day I'd like to move to Mars.
