If I'm to write about becoming a _data scientist_, I should first define what I mean by _data science_. A simple [Google search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+data+science%3F) yields over one billion results... so I'll do my best to summarize. (This is easier said than done, of course, since the concept has been around and [evolved considerably](http://smartdatacollective.com/gilpress/50120/evolution-what-data-science) since the 1970s, and a generally-accepted definition does not appear to exist.)

Another way to define data science is to describe the sort of work that's actually performed by data scientists. In [A Taxonomy of Data Science](http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/), [Hilary Mason](http://www.hilarymason.com/about/) and [Chris Wiggins](http://www.columbia.edu/~chw2/) list what a data scientist actually does, in approximate chronological order: obtain (finding and getting sufficient amounts of data from a variety of sources); scrub (cleaning up messy and/or incomplete data to make analysis possible); explore (looking at the data by reading numbers, basic plotting, and unsupervised clustering techniques); model (producing the most predictive model of the data possible, quantifying the accuracy of its predictions); and interpret (gleaning generalized insight from the model to produce data products and suggest directions for further inquiry). Not surprisingly, data scientists perform a wide array of specific tasks. According to [Jeff Hammerbacher](http://jeffhammerbacher.com/), who established the data science group at Facebook:

> "... on any given day, a team member could author a multistage processing pipeline in Python, design a hypothesis test, perform a regression analysis over data samples with R, design and implement an algorithm for some data-intensive product or service in Hadoop, or communicate the results of our analyses to other members of the organization."

_Amazing_. [Mike Driscoll](http://thephenomlist.com/Big_Data_Scientists/Michael_Driscoll) details the [three sexy skills of data geeks](http://www.dataspora.com/2009/05/sexy-data-geeks/) — statistics, data munging, and visualization — the last of which is a critical component of data science that I've not yet mentioned. Presenting the data such that its underlying structure is clear and visible facilitates a better understanding of the dataset itself, not to mention communication of your conclusions with others! On that note, here's a final, visual take on tasks now associated with data science, taken from a 2004 dissertation on computational information design by [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/):

So, as far as I can tell, that's data science in a nutshell. But, given that it's a new and varied field, I've probably missed some important points; if anybody out there has something to add, please do so in the comments!
