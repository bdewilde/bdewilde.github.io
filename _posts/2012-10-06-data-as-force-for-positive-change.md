[I've](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html) [been](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/business/how-big-data-became-so-big-unboxed.html?smid=pl-share) [reading](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/09/human-face-of-big-data/) a lot about how big data is or is going to revolutionize the world we live in. Yes, some of this is hype; yes, more data means more potential for statistical shenanigans and bad analysis; and yes, some changes may not necessarily be for the better (think: violation of privacy and [other unethical abuses](http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/06/ethics-big-data-business-decisions.html) of personal data). But it's important to recognize that data can be a powerful force for positive change in the world.

I'm not just talking about the obvious targets - [health care](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-17/the-health-care-industry-turns-to-big-data), [education](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/09/04-education-technology-west), [government](http://www.techamerica.org/Docs/fileManager.cfm?f=techamerica-bigdatareport-final.pdf), and so on - but a wide variety of social issues and challenges that could benefit from a data science intervention. The case for good was made quite wonderfully by Jake Porway, who compared data scientists to superheroes in a recent presentation at [DataGotham](http://www.datagotham.com/):

Near the end, Jake says, "You [data scientists] have extraordinary powers that ordinary people don't have... There are more opportunities than ever to get involved in using your skills for good." _Yes!_ And [DataKind](http://datakind.org/) (the organization he co-founded) seems like a great place to start. Part of their mission statement reads as follows:

> DataKind (formerly known as Data Without Borders) brings together leading data scientists with high impact social organizations through a comprehensive, collaborative approach that leads to shared insights, greater understanding, and positive action through data in the service of humanity.

It's like [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) for idealists! Of course I signed up. I love a challenge, and all the better if I can make make a difference while solving it. Consider this a \*nudge\* to all the data-savvy activists out there. ;)
