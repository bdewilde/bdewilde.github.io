Say what you will about [Elon Musk's Twitter](https://www.garbageday.email/i/83091513/comedy-is-legal-on-twitter-again-as-long-as-you-do-what-elon-musk-says), but in days past it was a decent way to stay up-to-date on happenings in various communities of interest. I followed data professionals and hackers, social commentators, journalists, scientists, and activists, plus a few friends and coworkers. My feed was decently curated, and despite some algorithmic froth, I considered it a valuable source of information. And yet...

I joined the great [#TwitterMigration](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitterMigration)'s first wave last fall, and eventually landed over on Mastodon. In hindsight, I realize that the volume of content, variability in its quality and relevance, and chronically toxic undercurrents made for a poor signal-to-noise ratio. It was mentally exhausting to keep up with, let alone participate in, The Discourse. And I had the growing sense that posts were being written for -- and sometimes by! -- an algorithm. [This experience](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/01/the-problem-with-twitter) isn't new or novel, but it reached a critical point for me personally in 2022. I needed a better way to consume information online.

I decided to focus on a few subjects of particular interest and value, confine my reading to a more regular schedule, and have the information come to me rather than the other way around. In other words, I went on an [information diet](https://medium.com/future-crunch/the-information-diet-b84d683681ce). The easiest approach I found was to replace social media feeds with subscriptions to a curated set of email newsletters.

Here are my current favorites, grouped by subject matter:

#### society and politics

- [WTFJHT](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com): Consistent, objective summary of current events, focused on U.S. politics. The author is thoughtful and transparent, keeps commentary to a minimum, and seems to genuinely care about his readers. Daily.
- [Big Tent](https://crooked.com/newsletters/#big-tent): "Insider" political commentary, firmly grounded in reality, with a strong perspective and zero patience for bullshit. Weekly.
- [Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email): Sharp commentary -- and some shit-posting -- about internet culture and tech in general. Lives at the edges of a weirder, more interesting web. M/W/F.

#### climate change

- [The Weekly Planet](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/weekly-planet): News and opinion focused on climate change, published by _The Atlantic_. The original author left fairly recently, and now it's... not as good. I'm giving it some time to find a new voice. Weekly.
- [Distilled](https://www.distilled.earth): Well-researched, independent climate journalism, occasionally investigative or collaborative, that does a good job of debunking lies and deniers. Weekly-ish.

#### data and engineering

- [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com): Curated collection of links to interesting posts, projects, threads, and resources covering all things tech/programming. Split into sections by subject, which helps to filter it down. Weekly.
- [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org): Generic but useful set of links to articles, projects, and learning resources in data science. Always skimmed, seldom clicked. Weekly.
- [PyCoder's Weekly](https://pycoders.com): Good overview of current developments/discussions in the Python community, plus some tutorials, projects, and events. Skews a bit toward beginners, but I still like it. Weekly.

#### local happenings

- [Burlington Mayor's Updates](https://www.burlingtonvt.gov/mayor/mayorsupdates): News, policy, and soapboxing from the mayor of Burlington, even though I rarely agree with him. [Stand-in for any local government official.] Monthly-ish.
- [Burlington City Arts newsletter](https://www.burlingtoncityarts.org): News, press releases, and event details dedicated to art and culture in the community. BCA's studio is where I make pottery! [Stand-in for any local cultural org.] Monthly-ish.
- [Edgewater Environmental Coalition newsletter](https://www.edgewaterenvironmentalcoalition.org/connect): News and events for my (former) neighborhood environmental org. [Stand-in for any local advocacy nonprofit.] Bi-monthly.

This list changes often. I unsubscribe when a newsletter stops serving my needs; on the flip side, I'm quick to subscribe when something new catches my eye. Maintaining a healthy information diet requires some degree of attention and care, unlike casual (doom)scrolling through Twitter. The most important thing is to be intentional.

I'm still trying to find my way post-Twitter with regards to building and participating in an online community. I know I'm not the only one. The situation with Mastodon feels transitional -- I like the concept, but I'm not convinced by the execution. For now, I'm resurrecting this personal/professional blog, so I can at least put my voice back out there. Maybe it'll make a positive contribution, however small, to someone else's information diet.
