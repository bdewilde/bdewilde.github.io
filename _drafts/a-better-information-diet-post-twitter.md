Say what you will about [Elon Musk's Twitter](https://www.garbageday.email/i/83091513/comedy-is-legal-on-twitter-again-as-long-as-you-do-what-elon-musk-says), but in days past it was a decent way to stay up-to-date on happenings in various communities of interest. I followed data professionals and hackers, social commentators, journalists, scientists, and activists, plus a few friends and coworkers. My feed was decently curated, and despite some algorithmic froth, I considered it a valuable source of information. And yet...

I joined the great [#TwitterMigration](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitterMigration)'s first wave last fall, and eventually landed over on Mastodon. In hindsight, I realize that the volume of content, variability in its quality and relevance, and chronically toxic undercurrents made for a poor signal-to-noise ratio. It was mentally exhausting to keep up with, let alone participate in, The Discourse. And I had the growing sense that posts were being written for -- and sometimes by! -- an algorithm. [This experience](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/01/the-problem-with-twitter) isn't new or novel, but it reached a critical point for me personally in 2022. I needed a better way to consume information online.

I decided to focus on a few subjects of particular interest and value, confine my reading to a more regular schedule, and have the information come to me rather than the other way around. In other words, I went on an ["information diet"](https://medium.com/future-crunch/the-information-diet-b84d683681ce). The best approach I found was to replace social media feeds with subscriptions to a curated set of email newsletters.

Here are my current favorites, grouped by subject matter:

#### current events / politics

- [WTFJHT](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com): Consistent, objective summary of current events, focused on U.S. politics, sent daily on weekdays. The curator is thoughtful and transparent, and keeps commentary to a minimum.
- [Big Tent](https://crooked.com/newsletters/#big-tent)
- [Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email)

#### science and climate

- [The Weekly Planet](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/weekly-planet)
- [Distilled](https://www.distilled.earth)

#### data and engineering

- [HackerNews](https://hackernewsletter.com)
- [PyCoder's Weekly](https://pycoders.com)
- [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org)

#### local happenings

- [Burlington Mayor's Updates](https://www.burlingtonvt.gov/mayor/mayorsupdates)
