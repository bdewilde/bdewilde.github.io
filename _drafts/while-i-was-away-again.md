After another lengthy hiatus from blogging, I'm back! Long story short, I got so frustrated with [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com)'s shortcomings and complications, not to mention the general lack of control over my content, that I lost the will to update my old blog. At the same time, I was putting in longer hours at [Harmony Institute](http://harmony-institute.org/) and volunteering on the side for [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) --- none of which I was at liberty to blog about outside of official channels --- so I didn't have much to say, anyway.

By the way, here are the relevant official posts:

- [Measuring Shifts in National Discourse: A Case Study](http://harmony-institute.org/therippleeffect/2013/11/27/measuring-shifts-in-national-discourse-a-case-study/)
- [Building and Analyzing Issue-Focused Social Networks on Twitter](http://harmony-institute.org/therippleeffect/2014/05/22/building-and-analyzing-issue-focused-social-networks-on-twitter/)
- [Big Data, Big Impact](http://www.datakind.org/blog/big-data-big-impact/)
- [Highlights from Project Accelerator Night](http://www.datakind.org/blog/highlights-from-project-accelerator-night/)

Recently, life slowed down a bit, and I started exploring my options for building a custom blog / personal website. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) was an obvious choice, for a number of reasons.

- __It's simple:__ Jekyll automagically converts a directory of specially marked-up text files into a static website. My content lives in files on my local machine rather than a remote database.
- __It's lightweight:__ Since the site is static and generated _before_ deployment to a server, it loads much faster and can handle far more traffic than a dynamic site. Plus, the relatively bare-bones HTML+CSS is easier to understand and customize.
- __It's coder-friendly:__ Jekyll was built by [the folks at GitHub](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) for use by readme-writing coders and tech-savvy bloggers --- people like me. Posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/); lists, links, images, quotes, code blocks, and more are all seamlessly integrated into text. I can produce new content entirely from the comfort of my terminal and favorite text editor.
- __It's free:__
