Given that you're currently reading a data science blog, you're probably well aware that online resources for an informal education in data science abound. Blogs are a great place to start ([here](http://www.p-value.info/), [here](http://datascience101.wordpress.com/), [here](http://flowingdata.com/), [here](http://simplystatistics.org/), [here](http://blog.kaggle.com/)), but topics and pedagogical quality are --— let's be honest --— scattershot at best. No comment on the usefulness of _this_ particular blog...

As I've mentioned before, MOOCs are [rapidly maturing](http://blog.coursera.org/post/43625628117/29-new-schools-92-new-courses-5-languages-4) and expanding into a viable educational resource (with some [caveats](http://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeprose/2013/01/28/moocs-a-college-education-online/) and [warnings](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/04/coursera-forced-call-mooc-amid-complaints-about-course), of course). Personally, I've learned a great deal through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) courses in the past, and am currently enrolled in two: [Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis) with Jeff Leek and Natural Language Processing with [Michael Collins](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlangp). (Both are now in progress, but maybe it's not too late to sign up!) Even though I have a great deal of _experiential_ education in these topics —-- and formal education in scientific data analysis --— following along with an instructor helps me consolidate prior knowledge and incorporate new information into a more structured conceptual framework. Yes, this is an obvious statement on how one learns.

Attending a conference (or viewing videos/slides after-the-fact) is a great way to network and learn about recent developments in the field. I've been meaning to do this for ages but am continually surprised when a major data conference comes and/or goes before I'm made aware of it. _Sigh_. On that note, [Strata 2013](http://strataconf.com/strata2013/) just came to a close, and some videos and presentations are available [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL055Epbe6d5ZEYjq8K7CA37-1fEST-yWe) and [here](http://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/proceedings). For example, check out how one video game publisher is updating its data pipeline and philosophy:

[I've discussed]({% post_url 2012-10-03-how-to-learn-data-science-2 %}) these and other informal/online resources for learning data science before, but what about people interested in a formal (and perhaps _accredited_) data science education? Fortunately, data science has been expanding more and more into a traditional forum: Academia.\*

A couple weeks ago NYU announced the launch of a new [Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/) and the first offering of an [M.S. in Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/) this coming fall (now accepting applications). It looks as if they'll also be incorporating data science into several programs over a range of disciplines — very exciting news! I'm also happy to see that one of their "associated faculty" members is [Kyle Cranmer](http://physics.as.nyu.edu/object/kylecranmer.html), a high-energy physicist working on the ATLAS experiment, as I used to be.

Last fall, Columbia University's Department of Statistics offered [Introduction to Data Science](http://columbiadatascience.com/about-the-class/) and published [a really excellent blog](http://columbiadatascience.com/blog/) to go along with it. Incidentally, two of the instructors for the course, Rachel Schutt and Cathy O'Neill aka [mathbabe](http://mathbabe.org/), now share an office with me! :) They're greatly expanding their efforts with a new [Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering](http://idse.columbia.edu/). According to their website, the IDSE "is in the process of developing interdisciplinary graduate certification programs, certificates and Master’s degrees to support IDSE’s educational mission. Part-time, full-time and online study opportunities will be available beginning Fall 2013." It looks like [the instructor](http://idse.columbia.edu/michael-collins) for my Coursera NLP course is associated with the IDSE --— small world!

And this is just the beginning! Ryan Swanstrom of [Data Science 101](http://datascience101.wordpress.com/) (one of my favorite blogs) has compiled [a list of data science (or related) programs](http://datascience101.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/colleges-with-data-science-degrees/) in higher education. Most are graduate programs, but a handful are for undergrads. I'm a big proponent of self-directed learning and experiential education, but there's certainly something to be said for a structured, formal education in such a diverse, multi-disciplinary field. And it's always good to have options! :) Plus, [an oft-cited 2011 study](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation) by the McKinsey Global Institute projects a shortage of about 150,000 individuals with data science skills by 2018 —-- so get learning, people!

\* A footnote for the sticklers and cynics: Yes, data science (broadly defined) has long had a place in Academia under the scope of Computer Science and Mathematics/Statistics departments, but no, it's not just [sexy rebranding](http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/ar/1) of an existing discipline. Considering that data science is fundamentally multi-disciplinary, I believe that the recent development of dedicated data science programs represents something new and belongs to a broader trend in education away from excessive specialization.
